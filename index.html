				<h2>For men and men alone</h2>
				<p>Honestly, we would be surprised if any women enjoyed it. This is a breakthrough for men. It makes the Internet a more comfortable place for those of us who don’t love shoe shopping and tea parties. Anyone can download it, but men are far more likely to appreciate it.</p>

			<h2>The story of the Handsome Browser</h2>
		</div>
		<!-- text section -->
		<div class="fullText">
			<p>It’s time to face the facts. <strong>The Internet doesn’t care if you’re a man.</strong></p>
			<p>Your children care. Your lover cares. You care. But the second you strut into cyberspace, you’re a genderless s/he whose only significance is whatever ads Mark ZuckerBorg wants to sling your way.</p>
			<p>That’s not how the Internet should be, fellows. We are brothers, and it’s time the Web knew.</p>
			<p>Think about your grandfather. Did he put up with Communism?</p>
			<p>Think about your great-grandfather. Did he put up with Nazism?</p>
			<p>So why should you put up with an Internet that just wants to rip out your mustache, dress you in a unisex toga, and pretend there’s no difference between men and women?</p>
			<p>It’s a grave struggle that all men have shared since December 20, 1990. That’s the day the world’s first website went live. And that first website did nothing to recognize the men visiting it. Since that day, websites have followed suit, with precious few bloggers championing the cause of gender-specific Web browsing.</p>
			<p>Here’s the shocker: most of the people behind the World Wide Web were men. You would think that these heroes of the Information Age would have looked across the supercollider one day and realized that the Internet needed to recognize men and women for their distinct perspectives, characteristics, preferences, and ways of life. But this obvious need was lost in their haste to make the world a better place.</p>
			<p>And after the Internet was launched, they had so many pressing things to deal with that this to-do item migrated from “Critical for leaving beta” to “Someday/maybe.” It has been on the back burner ever since.</p>
			<p>We still respect them. In fact, without them, there would be no Handsome Browser. We salute you, Tim Berners-Lee, and we have your back.</p>
			<p>That’s why we created the Handsome Browser. It’s the Internet for men.</p>
			<p>Why didn’t we create an Internet for women? Because we’re not women, and we don’t presume to know what women want to experience online. But the world is brimming with top-notch female coders, dreamers, and Web designers. We are confident that a feminine counterpart to the Handsome Browser will arrive someday soon.</p>
			<p>But this isn’t about women. This is about the marginalized men of the Internet. This is about the men who wonder if masculinity means anything in the Information Age. Yes, gentlemen, it does. And the Handsome Browser is here to prove it. This new Internet is already teeming with good-natured, hard-working, masculine life—and you can join it right now. It’s a way for men to use the Web in a way that recognizes us for what we are:</p>
